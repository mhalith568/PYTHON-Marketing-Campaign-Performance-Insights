💡 Key Insights (Editable Based on Your Data)

Social Media had the highest engagement but moderate conversions

Email campaigns showed the best conversion rate with low cost

Younger audience (18–35) displayed maximum interaction and CTR

Cost per Acquisition was high in certain locations, affecting ROI

Short duration campaigns showed better performance than long-running ones

Certain campaigns generated high impressions but low conversions, indicating poor targeting

🚀 Business Recommendations

Increase budget allocation for email & targeted social media ads

Optimize underperforming locations with high acquisition cost

Focus more on high-CTR, high-ROI campaigns

Improve creatives or targeting for low-performing campaigns

Maintain optimal campaign duration for better engagement

Tailor ads for the 18–35 audience, as they show the highest response
